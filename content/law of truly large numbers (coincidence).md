- The law of truly large numbers says that with a large enough sample many odd coincidences are likely to happen.
- Some people find it surprising that there are more than 16 million others on the planet who share their birthday. 
- At a typical football game with 50,000 fans, most fans are likely to share their birthday with about 135 others in attendance.
- You may find it even more astounding that "In a random selection of twenty-three persons there is a 50 percent chance that at least two of them celebrate the same birthdate" 🤔
