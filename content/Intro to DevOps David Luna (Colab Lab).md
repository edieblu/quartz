## Key principles and practices
- Customer-centric action (customer is the main stakeholder, short feedback loops with customers and end-to-end users)
- Cross-Functional autonomous teams with end-to-end responsibility (you build it, you run it)
- Continuous improvement (minimize waste, optimize for speed, costs, and ease of delivery, continuously improve products and services offered)
- Automation (automate in every state of software development lifecycle SDLC)
