⬅️ [[Deep dive into Anki]]

- `~/Library/Application Support/Anki2`
## Backups
- Each time your collection is closed (when closing Anki, switching profiles, or synchronizing your deck), Anki exports your collection into the backups folder. By default Anki will store up to 30 backups; you can adjust this in the preferences.
