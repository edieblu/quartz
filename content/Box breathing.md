⬅️ [[Breathing]]

Breath is broken down into four different steps:

1. Inhale
2. Hold
3. Exhale
4. Hold

- Inhale through your nose for 4 seconds.
- Hold for 4 seconds
- Exhale through your nose for 4 seconds
- Hold for 4 seconds
- Repeat

**Use it to help periods of high stress** (e.g. during cold showers), to manage anxiety, or as a way to reset your mind during mundane tasks (e.g. in meetings, while walking).
