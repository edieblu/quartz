- the appeal to the popularity of a claim as a reason for accepting it
- The number of people who believe a claim is irrelevant to its truth.
- The _ad populum_ fallacy is also referred to as _the bandwagon fallacy, the appeal to the mob, the democratic fallacy_, and _the appeal to popularity_.

## Examples
- “The fact that the majority of our citizens support the death penalty proves that it is morally right.”
- “Gods must exist, since every culture has some sort of belief in a higher being.”
