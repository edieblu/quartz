üîó [Best practices for working with AWS Lambda functions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/best-practices.html)
- By analyzing the `Max Memory Used:` field, you can determine if your function needs more memory or if you over-provisioned your function's memory size.
- **Load test your Lambda function**
- **Test with different batch and record sizes** so that the polling frequency of each event source is tuned to how quickly your function is able to complete its task. The [CreateEventSourceMapping](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/API_CreateEventSourceMapping.html) BatchSize parameter controls the maximum number of records that can be sent to your function with each invoke. A larger batch size can often more efficiently absorb the invoke overhead across a larger set of records, increasing your throughput.
- **Monitor your usage of AWS Lambda as it relates to security best practices by using AWS Security Hub.**
