## Classes
Access modifier keywords (great for encapsulation, but not security!):
- `public` 	everyone (this is the default)
- `protected` 	the instance itself, and subclasses
- `private` 	only the instance itself


- Classes have fields (data) and methods (functions), both of which need static types. Fortunately, fields use syntax similar to variables, and methods use syntax similar to functions.
