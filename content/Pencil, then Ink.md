- how similar the process of good drawing is to good learning
- Rigor (permanent inked lines) helps cement ideas after the intuitive pencil structure has been put into place

- Beginners need the pencil marks -- experts who've internalized them sometimes forget that. 
- True learning happens when people can recreate that structure in their minds
- I want to share the pencil sketches that evolved into the elephant, instead of erasing them and pretending that I, too, can just draw from memory.

> [!tip] Don't learn by tracing: find (or invent!) those pencil structures.
