⬅️ [[Breathing]]
## Instructions:
- Inhale for 4 seconds (nose)
- Exhale for 4 seconds (nose)
- Hold the breath for 4 seconds

Repeat.

For a balanced nervous system use this 4:4:4 ration
For a sympathetic nervous system ratio use 4:1:4 
For a parasympathetic nervous system ratio use 4:8:8

See [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43H-C40cDI0) for a tutorial.

Use triangle breathing to readjust your nervous system based on your current state.  Play around with the ratios to find one you like.  Or do a pyramid within the triangle by adding one second on (per side of the triangle) for 5 rounds and then decrease for the next 5 rounds.
