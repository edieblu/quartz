‚¨ÖÔ∏è [[Travel and Living Abroad]]

üîó from [WITI](https://whyisthisinteresting.substack.com/p/the-atmospherics-edition)

There is an art to ‚Äòcollecting‚Äô on a faraway place, something that modern-day intelligence officers call ‚Äúatmospherics.‚Äù Naturally, there‚Äôs a mnemonic [PDF]: PMESII-PT, used to analyze atmospherics across eight dimensions.

1. **Political**: Who holds the real power and influence, officially and unofficially? A rural village may technically be governed from the distant capital, but the local police chief is the one who can ruin your trip or be your greatest ally.¬†
    
2. **Military**: Are armed militias or organized crime syndicates active? A crowded market devoid of women and children could signal an impending attack, whereas regular and professional checkpoints might indicate a strong security presence.¬†

3. **Economic**: What are the patterns of commerce and consumption? Bustling shops, well-stocked shelves and generous haggling may indicate a thriving economy. Shuttered storefronts and bare markets might indicate trouble.

4. **Social**: What are the ethnic, religious, and cultural traditions, and the fault lines? Seemingly banal choices like clothing or cuisine could constitute a major _faux pas_ whereas even a cursory attempt at proper honorifics in the local dialect can win fast friends.
    
5. **Information:** How open and reliable are the channels of communication? State-controlled media and patchy cell service can constrain the flow of information. Neighborhood gossip ([RUMINT](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/rumint)) might be the most trusted news source, and can be accessed with the offer of a cigarette or even a genuine smile.
    
6. **Infrastructure**: Are the basic needs of water, power, transportation and healthcare being met? Knowing the nearest hospital or carrying a few [iodine tablets](https://www.amazon.com/Purification-Effective-Emergencies-Disasters-International/dp/B0BVQVNJNG) can be the difference between an enriching trip and a catastrophic [bubble gut](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/travelers-diarrhea).
    
7. **Physical Environment:** How do climate and geography impact daily life? Monsoon rains or rugged terrain dictate the rhythms of the local calendar, and can quickly upset the best-laid travel plans.
    
8. **Time** - What significant dates loom on the [calendar](https://www.timeanddate.com/holidays/)? Elections, holidays, and anniversaries of historic events focus a population's anxieties and joy. The local [perception](https://hbr.org/2016/05/different-cultures-see-deadlines-differently) of time can heavily influence the number of museums you might visit, or tell you the best hours to party down with new friends.
