## Semantic versioning
With semantic versioning, every version number is of the form: **major.minor.patch**:

- If a new release does not change the API, increase the **patch** version. (security fixes)
- If you add to your API in a backward-compatible way, increase the **minor** version.
- If you change the API in a non-backward-compatible way, increase the **major** version.
