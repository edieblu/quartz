## JavaScript Bloat in 2024

tldr: 10MB  of JavaScript is not a lot? 🤷‍♂️

## Writing Javascript without a build system
🔗 [here](https://jvns.ca/blog/2023/02/16/writing-javascript-without-a-build-system/)

Build systems can do lots of useful things, like:
- combining 100s of JS files into one big bundle (for efficiency reasons)
- translating Typescript into Javascript
- typechecking Typescript
- minification
- adding polyfills to support older browsers
- compiling JSX
- treeshaking (remove unused JS code to reduce file sizes)
- building CSS (like [tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) does)
- and probably lots of other important things

Examples of build systems:
- webpack, rollup, esbuild, parcel, or vite
