## Cold shower routine
1. week 1: 30 seconds of cold water at the end of a warm shower
2. week 2: one minute of cold water at the end of a warm shower
3. week 3: one minute and half of cold water at the end of a warm shower
4. week 4: two minutes of cold water at the end of a warm shower
Practice five days a week.
## How to get warm
1. Sit down
2. Inhale slowly and deeply five or six times, letting your breath go naturally each time.
3. Inhale fully.
4. Relax to exhale.
5. Inhale fully.
6. Hold your breath, for no more than five seconds.
7. Tense your upper-back muscles and chest while you hold your breath - but don't tense the head. Keep your jaw relaxed.

With practice, you will feel the heat coming from inside your body.
## Basic breathing exercise
1. sit in meditation posture, close your eyes, clear your mind
2. Take 30-40 deep breaths through the nose, fill up your belly, your chest all they way up to your head. Don't force the exhale, just relax and let the air out. Fully in, letting go.
3. At the end of last breath, draw the breath in once more and fill the lungs to maximum capacity without using any force. Then relax to let the air out. Hold the breath until you feel the urge to breathe again. (retention phase)** Keep your lungs uninflated for as long as you can.**
4. Take one deep breath in and hold it for ten to fifteen seconds (recovery phase)
5. Let your breath go and start with a new round.

Repeat 3-4 times.
Use the Wim Hof method as a way to increase your resilience to stress.¬† Similar to holotropic breathwork you can use it to increase your alertness, mental clarity, and creativity.¬† Don‚Äôt do it before exercising.
