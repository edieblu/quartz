How to fall asleep in 2 minutes? (military technique)
- Progressive relaxation techniques
- feel your body relaxed and soft, drop you shoulders as low as possible
- breath in deeply and exhale slowly
- imagine a feeling of warmth coming down from the top of your body to your fingertips and toes
- think of a canoe on a serene lake, beneath a blue sky
- think of a black velvet hammock in a completely dark room
- repeat to yourself "Don't think." for 10 seconds
