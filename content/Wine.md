## ## How to taste and assess wine
- Look at the wine against a white piece of paper or table cloth (do not hold it up to the light). **SEE** its color and color intensity. For example: is it a bright ruby red visible to the core? Or a rich purple with an opaque centre?
- Swish the wine in the glass and **SMELL**, paying attention to any fruit notes and then floral, herbal, and spicy aromas.
- **TASTE** the wine, concentrating on its spectrum of flavors. Try to discern its _acid_ (tartness—makes your mouth water), _alcohol_ (heat felt on the palate, sinuses, and chest—like when you take a shot of tequila), _sweetness_, and _tannins_ (dries your mouth out).
- **FEEL** the wine in your mouth. Is it light or does it have weight? Is it smooth and velvety or bright and fresh? Does it leave your mouth luxuriously coated or feeling like you’ve gargled with paint stripper?

## The principal grapes of the world
- **Cabernet Sauvignon** is a dark ruby **red wine** that’s **full bodied**
- Sauvignon Blanc is **medium bodied whine**

## How are wines named?
In many non-European countries (like the USA, Australia, Chile, New Zealand, and South Africa, etc.) the wines are usually named after the estate AND the **grape** from which they’re made. For example:

- Château Montelena **Chardonnay** (California, USA)
- Lanzerac **Pinotage** (Stellenbosch, South Africa)
- St Hugo **Shiraz** (Barossa Valley, Australia)

In many European countries, however, wines are **named after the geographic region, village, or even vineyard** from which they come. For example:

- **Champagne** is a wine region in northeastern France
- **Chianti** is a region of central Tuscany, Italy
- **Ribera del Duero** is a Spanish wine region located in the country's northern plateau

Red Burgundies are made from 100% Pinot Noir and white Burgundies, Chardonnay.


## How to store your wine properly
The golden rule of storing wine, whether it’s for next month or next decade, is to keep it somewhere **(1) cool, (2) dark,** and **(3) away from temperature fluctuations,** and **(4) away from vibrations.**

**Pro Tip:** Wine bottles with corks in them should be stored on their side so that the cork can remain moist and sealed. Wines with screw caps can be stored upright.

## What glass should I serve wine in?
- larger wine glasses with broader bowls for red wines 
- glasses with smaller, narrower bowls for white wines.
- flutes for champagne or sparkling wine

## The temperatures at which to serve different wines
- Full-bodied red wines, like Cabernet Sauvignons or Bordeauxs are **served cool:** between 17˚C and 20˚C (63˚F and 68˚F)
- Lighter style red wines, like unoaked Pinot Noirs or Gamays, are **served chilled:** between 10˚C and 17˚C (50˚F and 63˚F)
- More bodacious white wines, like oaked Chardonnays, are **served chilled:** between 9˚C and 15˚C (48˚F and 59˚F)
- Lighter style white wines, like crisp Sauvignon Blancs or Pinot Grigios, are **served even chillier**: between 7˚C and 12˚C (45˚F and 54˚F)
- Sparkling and dessert wines, like Champagne or Sauternes, are **served ice cold**: between 5˚C and 7˚C (40˚F and 45˚F), which is technically not _ice cold_ but you get the point.

## The basic rules for pairing wines with foods
- rule of thumb: white wines go with lighter dishes and white meats, while red wines go with stronger-flavored foods and red meat dishes
-  The wine should be at least as acidic as the food
- The wine should be sweeter than the food, especially with the dessert course
- The wine should have the same flavor intensity as the food
- Red wines pair best with heavy meats, like beef and lamb
- White wines pair best with lighter meats, like fish and chicken
- Acidic wines are best balanced with fatty meals
- The wine should never overpower the food and vice versa

## What is a non-vintage wine?
A non-vintage or “NV” wine is one that is made from a blend of two or more years’ wines, and so it isn’t specific to any one vintage. Winemakers often do this when they’re looking to make a super consistent wine that changes little from year-to-year.
