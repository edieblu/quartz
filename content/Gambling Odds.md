## American odds
- -145 means you need to bet $145 in order to win $100, in addition to getting back your $145 wager. 
- +125 means you will win an additional $125 if you bet $100, for a total payout of $225.

## British (Fractional) Odds

- With fractional odds, the ratio is equivalent to your potential payout (the numerator) and your wager (the denominator), and then reduced to the smallest version of that fraction. At 5/8 odds, you could win $5 for every $8 that you bet.

- Admittedly, it‚Äôs much easier to calculate your potential winnings with British odds than American odds. If you bet $160 at 5/8 odds, you could win an additional $160 * (5/8) = $100.

## European (Decimal) Odds
- They include the return of your wager in the representation.

- 1.625 odds means that a bet of $160 would return $160 * 1.625 = $260, but since European odds include paying back your original bet your winnings are actually $260 - $160 = $100.
