⬅️ [[Critical Thinking]]

- The proportionality bias is a tendency to believe that causes are proportional to effects in magnitude. Extreme events with momentous consequences have extreme, momentous causes. Mundane events have mundane causes.
- Example: conspiracy theory behind the killing of JFK
- Was Princess Diana the victim of drunk driving or a plot by the British royal family? Did Neil Armstrong really walk on the moon or just across a film set in Nevada? And who killed President John F. Kennedy - the Russians, the Cubans, the CIA, the mafia...aliens? Almost every big event has a conspiracy theory attached to it.
