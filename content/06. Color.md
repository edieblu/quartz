‚¨ÖÔ∏è [[CSS]]

- üîó from [here](https://web.dev/learn/css/color/)

## Hex
- you can add alpha values to hex codes! `#00000080` (black with 50% transparency)
-  0% alpha‚Äîwhich is fully transparent‚Äîis 00: `#00000000`
-  50% alpha is 80: `#00000080`
-  75% alpha is BF: `#000000BF`

## `rgb`
- `rgb(0 0 0 / 50%)` or `rgb(0 0 0 / 0.5)`  
(or, more supported:)
- `rgba(0, 0, 0, 50%)` or `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5)`
- Commas were removed from the `rgb()` and `hsl()` notation because newer color functions, such as `lab()` and `lch()` use spaces instead of commas as a delimiter (new color types).

## HSL
- HSL stands for hue, saturation and lightness
- Hue describes the value on the color wheel
- Saturation is how vibrant the selected hue is (saturation `0%` is grayscale) 
- Lightness describes the scale from black to white (`100%` is white)
- `hsl(0 0% 0%)` or `hsl(0deg 0% 0%)`
- to add alpha: `hsl(0 0% 0% / 50%)` or `hsl(0 0% 0% / 0.5)`. 
- Using the `hsla()` function: `hsla(0, 0%, 0%, 50%)` or `hsla(0, 0%, 0%, 0.5)`.

## Color keywords
- There are [148 named colors in CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value#color_keywords).
- all color keywords are case-insensitive
-  `transparent` is a fully transparent color. It is also the initial value of `background-color`
- `currentColor` is the contextual computed dynamic value of the `color` property.

## Where?
