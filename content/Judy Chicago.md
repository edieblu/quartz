⬅️ [[Artists (Women)]]

- _The Dinner Party_ is a monument to women’s history and accomplishments. It is a massive triangular table—measuring 48 feet on each side—with thirty-nine place settings dedicated to prominent women throughout history and an additional 999 names are inscribed on the table’s glazed porcelain brick base.
- Five years in the making (1974-1979) and the product of the volunteer labor of more than 400 people, _The Dinner Party_ is a testament to the power of feminist vision and artistic collaboration.
