**Everything displayed by CSS is a box.**
- Extrinsic sizing vs intrinsic sizing: extrinsic is when you define it, intrinsic is when the content does (e.g. `min-content`). So you are avoiding overflows with intrinsic sizing? 🤔
- When you switch to intrinsic sizing, you are letting the browser make decisions for you, based on the box's content size. 
- Huh, the scrollbars occupy the `padding` space

- `outline` and `box-shadow` come inside the `margin` space

- the default `box-sizing` value is `content-box` (meaning `padding` and `border` values are added on top of the width)

Resetting:

```css
*,*::before,*::after {  
	box-sizing: border-box;
}
```
