Types of cards:
- mature: A mature card is one that has an interval of 21 days or greater.
- young: A young card is one that has an interval of less than 21 days, but is not in learning.
- relearn: A relearning card is a card that you have failed in review mode, thus returning it to learning mode to be relearned.
