aka argument from incredulity

The divine fallacy, or the argument from incredulity, is a species of non sequitur reasoning which goes something like this: _I can't figure this out, so a god must have done it._ Or, _This is amazing; therefore, a god did it._ Or, _I can't think of any other explanation; therefore, a god did it._ Or, _this is just too weird; so, a god is behind it._

This fallacy is also a variation of the alien fallacy.
