## Promise states
1.  A promise can be **pending**, **fulfilled** with a value, or **rejected** with a reason.
2.  Pending promises can become fulfilled or rejected.
3.  Once a promise is fulfilled or rejected, it stays in that state forever.

- 💡 avoid saying resolved when you actually mean fulfilled!
