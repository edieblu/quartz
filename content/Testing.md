## Testing
- **Test suite**: all of the tests in the program
- **Unit test**: tests a single feature
- **Integration test**: tests the interaction between different subsystems of the program
- **Regression test**: tests things that were broken in the past. They prevent your projects from regressing to earlier bugs.
- **Mocking**: being able to replace the parts of your system with a dummy version of itself.
