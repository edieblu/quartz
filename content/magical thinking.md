⬅️ [[Critical Thinking]]

- magical thinking involves several elements, including a belief in the interconnectedness of all things through forces and powers that transcend both physical and spiritual connections.
- Magical thinking invests special powers and forces in many things that are seen as symbols.
- 'it is the interpreting of two closely occurring events as though one caused the other, without any concern for the causal link. For example, if you believe that crossing your fingers brought you good fortune, you have associated the act of finger-crossing with the subsequent welcome event and imputed a causal link between the two.
- In this sense, magical thinking is the source of many [superstitions](https://skepdic.com/superstition.html).
